    comments: "Been a few days since the last kill but we returned home from Lindesfarne to find a tiny bat scrabbling for its life in the utility room sink. We released it on the verge outside the front. It was injured, but hopefully not fatally. Sometimes we hate our cats. "

    comments: "No remains this morning but a shrew trotted into the living room at about 8am having been carried in by someone's murderous jaws at some point during the night. Eventually we trapped it under a plant pot and released it out the front. Shrews make a lot of noise when stressed!"
