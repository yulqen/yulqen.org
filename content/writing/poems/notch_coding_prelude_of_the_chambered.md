This was originally streamed on August 20th 2021 on Justin.tv \
A land long gone. \
Thank you to Nicklaus LoÌˆf for archiving the first part. \
I tried to use machine learning to upscale the video \
But none of the results gave me satisfactory results \
So this is it ladies and gentlemen. \
At least the audio is good on this one lol

Brutal! The first part is finally out, great job Hike, \
i have all of the jam games from Notch \
Some of them updated with resolutions and being adappted \
The one i can't find is Bunny Press \
If you know something about it please let me know. \
Fantastic work :]

when you start to learning programming basics and logic, \
and you go to watch this video \
you start to understand what he is doing \
edited: It's bad to watch this at poor quality \
but at least we can see this man working.

If you want to fix Notch flickering problem at 37:32 \
Just put the frame properties in this order \
frame.setVisible(true); \
frame.pack(); \
frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);

I found it quite *pressurising* that he did all the boilerplate \
code that I would normally not have to do if I was using something like \
Processing! \
Of course, Processing isn't for such professional use, but it was fun \
to see some actual Java code anyway, :o!... \
Thank you for the VOD, ";D! \
Edit: this is REALLY me when programming.

Thank you for uploading all the streams he did to youtube. \
Does he streams again building something to twitch?

3D stuff in 3 hours... Super cool!

Can anyone make a guide on how to build this?

21:52 when he starts.

Can anyone tell me the math or programming technique \
or idea behind the workings \
of the renderFloor() method \
around 1:11:06? I mean, \
how does he convert to 3D \
from a 2D set of pixels?
