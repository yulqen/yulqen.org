- Up and more configuring of the X1 laptop - today fixing the VSCode implementation, which is working quite nicely now.
- This is a really good page showing visually how the CSS flexbox system works: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-basics-and-terminology.
- Set up a matrix server on one of my VPSs today, using matrix-synapse - a Python program. I put a README somewhere on the server but I should really write it up here because that is the point of this journal.
