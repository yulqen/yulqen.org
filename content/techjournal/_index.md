I want to capture streams of links, references, ideas, excerpts and code snippets that I can come back to when needed, because I always forget. Not really for public consumption, despite the fact they are on the public internet.

October 2023: What I notice about doing this is how fickle I am with my interests.
I have always known this, but listing these links has hammered it home: one day I'm interested in Python, the next, Go, then C programming and then even *Visual Studio Code*, which as of today, I kind of despise.
But evidence suggests I was interested in it not long ago.
Baaah!
