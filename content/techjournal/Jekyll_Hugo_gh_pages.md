title: "From Jekyll and Github Pages, back to Hugo"

This is a new journal where I intend to dump technical stuff.

I was going to use Github Pages to host it, with Jekyll generating the stuff locally, but I couldn't get it to work. It feels like both technologies need some care. Either way, I remembered the utility of my own site, and here we are.

I haven't worked out exactly the format of this series yet, but I want it to be automated, so that I can easily dump links with short commentaries, and make it searchable somehow. Once again, it is all for my own sake.

Does code formatting work?

```python
def hello_world():
    print("hello, world!")
```

It seems to, but it doesn't have colour yet and it looks a bit big. Will work on that.
