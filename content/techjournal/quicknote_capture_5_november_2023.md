Been a bit of a crazy week or two, looking stuff up.
This has coincided with me undertaking a project to tear down a cloud server which has been running a number of my essential services for a number of years, and move it all to a new Beelink AMD machine that now sits on my home LAN.
Learning an awful lot about Proxmox (now not using), LXD (using), containers, Linux networking.

One massive pain was to move a matrix server (using synapse).
Decided to move it to [Dendrite](https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/).
Also implemented a NFS shared drive instead of trying to get `mpd` to stream from a LXC container, which wasn't happening.
This lot will get written up as a blog post in time.
