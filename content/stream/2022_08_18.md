I keep getting reminders at work telling me that I need to refresh my Diversity and Inclusion mandatory training. I had a quiet afternoon so thought I'd get it over and done with; turns out I still have a couple of months validity left - I last did it in *October 2021*. Can't believe I'm being made to do that course once a year but that's the reality when you work for a large organisation in these pitiful times. No one has the corporate bollocks to stand up to the D&I mob. [Jacob Rees-Mogg is absolutely right](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/jacob-rees-mogg-civil-service-training-woke-folderol-diversity-inclusion-check-yo-priviledge-witchcraft).
