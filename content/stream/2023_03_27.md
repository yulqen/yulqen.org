I am struggling with NixOS. Installing an old version of Pycharm Professional is the challenge and even ChatGPT doesn't know how to do it. So called experts on the NixOS Discourse are providing answers to similar questions from people who just want to install something in their system outside of `nixpkgs` and even they are routinely getting it wrong.

How to install Pycharm 2021.3.3, when that is not the latest, packaged version? It's very frustrating and forcing me to consider getting out of the Nix world.
