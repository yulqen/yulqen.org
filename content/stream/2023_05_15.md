After many years of slagging off VSCode and being a total vim snob (and oftentimes an Emacs snob - even worse), today I did a big switch to VSCode.

Reasons:

- Neovim - I was pulled in by the most recent hype, mainly on YouTube, and the promise of a Lua-saturated nirvana. Lua does look pretty cool and Neovim is clearly a good editor once you trick it out, but tricking it out was the problem... Too much work. VSCode does most of it anyway.
- The terminal. Managing two main work computers, on two different operating systems (Arch and Debian, having ditched NixOS recently, [as promised](https://yulqen.org/blog/quietly_moving_on_from_nixos/)), I've spent quite a lot of time recently getting my *terminal* in good shape. I've come to realise that life is a little too short to be back-and-forthing it between st, xterm (both of which have esoteric configuration requirements to say the least), gnome and alacritty. I just want to be able to Ctrl+V to paste into a buffer/file/window.
- VSCode is pretty good. I don't like Electron, but I'll live with it. It's just snappy enough. Plus, with some minimal configuration, I can translate most of my primciple vim bindings over.
