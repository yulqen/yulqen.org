**HIYA**!

Been toying with Stable Diffusion again and making dark images. Where the this interest with crucifixes another other ecumenical artefacts in waiting rooms come from, I don't know, but I used to try to make photorealistic scenes like this in Blender too. (What are those little hook/ledges under the seat of the chairs in the Blender image??)
