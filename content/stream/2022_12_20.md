Happy to be a contributor to [Denote](https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote) which is a simple Emacs package for notetaking. I really like it. My contribution is just documentation, but there is more to come as I learn Emacs - possibly some code on protecting journal files from accidental duplication.
