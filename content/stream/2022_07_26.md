First time I tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a few years ago I binned it after a few days of banging my head against brick wall. *It is not friendly to a non-programmer*. The documentation can be terse, often blurring the line between web stuff and Go-specific terminology that has nothing whatsover to do with a web site (`arrays` and `slices`, for example), with very little hand-holding or context-setting. I've written lots of computer programs, including programs written on Go, and I struggle with Hugo.

Tonight I've been trying to add a new page `about/programming` and been getting into knots understanding the often subtle issues related to layouts, lookup order, page types, leaf bundles, branch bundles, sections, and so on. Think I need to sleep on it.

Went to see [Minions: The Rise of Gru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions:_The_Rise_of_Gru) at [The Maltings](https://www.maltingsberwick.co.uk/) this morning. The autism-friendly screening, which was just loud enough to mask the crisp packet scrunching from the row behind.

Largely forgettable film, but it was nice to go the pictures with the family.
