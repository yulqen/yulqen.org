Went to see [Minions: The Rise of Gru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions:_The_Rise_of_Gru) at [The Maltings](https://www.maltingsberwick.co.uk/) this morning. The autism-friendly screening, which was just loud enough to mask the crisp packet scrunching from the row behind.

Largely forgettable film, but it was nice to go the pictures with the family.
