If you're a Scotland rugby fan, you can't help but be embarrassed by their performance against Ireland on Saturday (a sorry 36-14 loss), for the following reasons:

- The pre-match arrogance ("we will end their winning run" - Blair Kinghorn)
- The failure to take points on offer in the first ten minutes
- The absolute and total acceptance of defeat within twenty minutes (whenever Ireland scored their second try)
- The players in tears on the bench (Kinghorn again)
- The trip on Jonny Sexton by Ollie Smith and the smirking when given the yellow card
- The pathetic handbags following the trip and little push by Sexton
- The total lack of creativity and ideas in the face of an admittedly great defence
- The Finn Russell being a bit of an arse once given the captain's armband

There are probably many more reasons.
I get the difficulty of the task, but as ever, Scotland made it far more difficult for themselves thanks to what seem to be endemic shortcomings.

I think it will take years to rebuild.
Scotland have probably hit their ceiling and the only way is statis for a few years. Perhaps a decade, given the lack of kids coming through.
