> "If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a
sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason
for thinking as you do. If some one maintains that two and two
are five, or that Iceland is on the equator, you feel pity rather
than anger, unless you know so little of arithmetic or geography
that his opinion shakes your own contrary conviction. The most
savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is
no good evidence either way."
