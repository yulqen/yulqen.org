Now I know about [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).

Looking for a potential alternative to stock Android on my OnePlus 5 which ran out of updates some time ago. Not sure if these so called "privacy-focused" mobile OSs are any good. I've tried Lineage in the past and it was ok. Maybe I should look again.

Yawn.
