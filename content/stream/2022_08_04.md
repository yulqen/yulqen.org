Went to [Lindisfarne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne) today for a wander round. Did the nature trail circuit which was very much off the beaten track and a decent length walk. There's this white pyramid thing there.

We ate lunch at [The Barn at Beal](http://barnatbeal.com/).

Got home to find a bat in the sink, as detailed in the [cat kill log](../../blog/cats/cat_kills).
