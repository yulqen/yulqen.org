Found myself watching [Ted Hughes' Crow at Fifty: a Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnJ2c8iJRBc) on YouTube. Crow is one collection of [many] by Hughes that I've yet to really dig into. It's at the opposite end of the spectrum to Moortown Diaries which I love, in terms of theme and style. That fact it draws its own seminar says it all.
