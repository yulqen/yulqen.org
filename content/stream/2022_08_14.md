I've had enough of BBC coverage of the European Championships (and latterly the Commonwealth Games). Too much positivity for my liking, it wears you down eventually.

The Commonwealth Games was rigged so that England did better than they should have done, cheating Scotland and the SNP out of medals and glory; and no one from the likes of Uganda, Kenya or Turks & Caicos was ever interviewed. Wrong type of minorities.

Athletics is fundamentally a boring activity and running 200 metres can never involve strategy or tactics no matter how much they pay Michael Johnson (who looked like a wino) to tell us it does.

Went to Tesco today and filled a barrow two-thirds.

Exciting things happening parallel to the mundane, just not reportable.
