In the process of moving out of [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/).

This is not necessarily a reaction to the recent [DDoS attack](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/) suffered by them, which resulted in a week long outage, but that hasn't helped. The founder of Sourcehut probably knows more than he is letting on about why Sourcehut were targeted so precisely. It wouldn't be a surprise if it eminated from a faction of the internet intolerant of his often outspoken political [socialist] views (e.g [here](https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html), [here](https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/31/On-real-names.html) and [here](https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault/111789852549683667) to pick out some recent ones).

I really like Sourcehut and what it stands for: simplicity, freedom, no Javascript, use of email, etc, but I only went there on the first stop on my journey towards eventual freedom from the likes of Github. The next step for me is self-hosting at [git.yulqen.org](https://git.yulqen.org) using [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/). See you there!
