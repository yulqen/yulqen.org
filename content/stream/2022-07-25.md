Been out and about in Fife today. At times, wet.

Added an [email address](mailto:y@yulqen.org) to the [About](../about) page, just in case anyone wishes to say hello.

#### Bob and Boris

[Bob](../../blog/cats/cat_kills/) (at front: our cat) and Boris (neighbour's cat). They look nonchalent but they're wary of each other and don't really get along. Boris thinks it is his right to enter our house and eat Bob's food. Boris lives with a tortoishell cat called Maggie who often visits. She is similarly entitled.
