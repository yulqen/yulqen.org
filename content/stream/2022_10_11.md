Been reconfiguring computers. Running a mixture of Pop_OS! and Arch Linux on two of them now. One of my machines running OpenBSD is dying and another had problems, so I wiped one of them.

I like so much about OpenBSD but I wanted to switch back to Linux for a while. Linux is more performant and has better tooling available for software development and that's what I'm focusing on at the moment. This will change at some point, but for now...
