Went swimming this morning with Harvey.
We enjoyed it, but I miss the old pool with its flumes and wave machine.
The new one is kind of boring.

The best public swimming pool we've ever been to is [this one](https://www.srt.org.uk/centres/clickimin/facilities/swimming-pool) in Lerwick, Shetland.
The Rapid River Ride and Outdoor Lagoon make all the difference.
