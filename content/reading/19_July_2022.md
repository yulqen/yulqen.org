### [Derek Sivers' FAQ](https://sive.rs/faq)

I remember emailing him after a drive to Elgin, during which I ruminated on stuff that Derek likes to talk and write about (life, writing, music, stuff like that). I just wanted to introduce myself and test his claim that he replies to every personal email he gets. He replied.

He is also very much responsible for me first looking into [OpenBSD](https://sive.rs/openbsd), a subject about which I am currently somewhat obsessed, and his [views about plaintext](https://sive.rs/plaintext) are nothing new, but good to hear all the same.
