[The eeriness of the English Countryside](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/10/eeriness-english-countryside-robert-macfarlane).

This reminds me to read the outstanding book on my bookshelf by Robert Macfarlane. There are also lots of links and other things to follow up in here, including dusting off These New Puritans.
