title: Yulqen - Reading
---

I read a lot on the internet and would like to read more on paper, like the old days. My attention span is too feeble to sit down to read a book at this point, but I'm working on it.

Poetry is good because it's short and digestible. I don't use social media any more except Mastadon on occasion.
