I am a fantastically slow reader.
I bought this book in summer of 2023 and as of February 2024, I am on page 88.
Not that this is not a good book: it is a good book.
I put it down for several months.
A caesura, but a recoverable one.

I am enjoying reading about Stevens' life in the early 20th century and the feel and smell of this nice hardback book.
Reading about a literary figure and great poet who led a "boring" life, (Wallace being an insurance man).
But he knew [William Carlos Williams](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45502/the-red-wheelbarrow) and that [French guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp), who was a pioneer of Dada.

He drank.
He smoked.
He wrote poems.

How good a poet was Stevens?

Why has Frank Skinner not covered him yet?
