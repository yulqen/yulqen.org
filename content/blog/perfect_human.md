Mr Perfect. A sarcastic insult or a compliment, a tribute, adulation from someone misguided. It is actually more the sarcastic barb.

Of course, the Perfect Human is irony steeped in dripping, gooey irony. So slimy and hot with irony that you can't grab it.

Someone who thinks they are perfect is comical. They're perception about themselves aligns perfectly with what they believe perfection to be: that's two imperfect, faulty perceptions. In religion, only a perfect being would be able to contemplate perfection. In Buddhism this will be true also. I don't know, I'd need to research it.

Parallel flawed theories: two wrongs do not make a right. They multiply. They do not cancel each other out.

Let's say Mr Perfect believes his children are perfect too. An example that is very current is the scenario where a child is singing a solo in the school play. The child, to conventional ears, cannot sing. She sings out of tune and in fact has an aggrevating tone about her voice. Mr Perfect believes she is also perfect.

This gets us into the realm of perception. You can believe in something and act on it but you sense the opposite, yet you deny it. Only the truly deluded doesn't see this. This is when it tips into arrogance. Denial.
