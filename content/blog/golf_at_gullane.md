Got a great game of golf in though - at [Gullane No. 2](https://www.gullanegolfclub.co.uk/course_no_2). Here is the card (mine is the top line). Couple of big 8s ruined it. Don't think I've ever scored so many 5s and don't remember last time I went round without a 6, so quite a unique round.

No. 2 is quite a bit easier than No. 1 and the rough is lenient here. Not sure if that's because of the time of the year. Only lost one ball.

A few *very* temporary greens in action though on the back nine. Just a hole shoved in front of the green on the fairway whilst the greenkeepers were fucking around on the greens with some machinary (some sort of spiker and a little ride-on rolling machine that moves sideways, is my layman's take on it).
