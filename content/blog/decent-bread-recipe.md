This is a decent recipe if you like a rustic, hipster loaf like I do.
Thanks to [some chap on the X](https://x.com/kepano/status/1709600244844101908?t=0MHIqDF49tztnC9bKNTz5A).

## Ingredients

- 475g bread flour
- 1 packet active dry yeast (7g)
- 1 tsp salt
- 365g filtered water

## Steps

1. mix all ingredients in a bowl with a wooden spoon until it just comes together (2 min)
2. let rise overnight (8-10h)
3. move dough to a heavily floured surface, scrape from the edges of the bowl to avoid collapsing the air bubbles
4. form into a one big rough oblong shape
5. cut dough in half lengthwise
6. transfer each half directly onto a baking rack, pull ends to stretch into a rough baguette shape
7. bake at highest temp (500F) for 25 minutes on lowest rack in the oven with convection

For big air pockets avoid pressing down on the dough at any stage.
