The cats have started killing again. Several mice, including one which was still alive in the morning. We tried to nurse it back to life wrapped in a tea towel in the salad spinner and gave it peanut butter on sesame Rivita, but it died. We slipped it in a nappy sack and put it in the back room bin where it eventually got covered in old cat meat. That was a few days ago and it's still there.
