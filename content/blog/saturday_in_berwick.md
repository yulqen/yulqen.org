We went to [The Granary Gallery](https://www.thegalleryguide.co.uk/galleries/granary-gallery) in Berwick today for a coffee and the weather was nice enough to take it outside.

Unlike most of the rest of the town, the patio area wasn't pasted with seagull excrement (Marygate is particularly enwhitened, adding to its delapidation). I'm not a Berwicker or have been in-tune enough during the five years I've lived here to have noticed whether this is an annual thing or arising from the weather, the economy, climate-change, or what. What's making the gulls so nonchalent? I've never noticed it before. Maybe we just need some rain.

Then we went to Costa for a sandwich and bought supplies and puzzles and stuff for the children at the cheap shops on the way home.
