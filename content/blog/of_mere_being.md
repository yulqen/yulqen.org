Go [read Of Mere Being by Wallace Stevens](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57671/of-mere-being).

> The palm at the end of the mind,

Stevens' poetry defies explanation and that is an enigmatic and wonderful first line.

For me this poem has such a baking glow: the palm, the gold-feathered bird, the bronze. The palm brings the heat and the desert. And all of it at the "end" of the mind. At a boundary of space and time, when the mind and reason matters no longer, far from meaning.

That's what poetry can and should be.
