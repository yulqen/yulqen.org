Ah, springtime! A time of awakening, rebirth, burgeoning buds - and avian
bloodshed. And a good deal of mammal death, too.

This year we are taking account of the savagery, perhaps to try to atone for the
guilt we suffer for allowing [Sadie, Cinnamon and Bob]({{< relref "#the-perpetrators" >}}) 
to exact such terror on the local wildlife.

Here then is a simple list of slaughtered fauna for 2021. 

#### Current analysis as of 21 June 2021:

<p><em>After an active period in May, the kill-rate has slowed a bit, but we
suspect we're not seeing the victims...</em></p>
