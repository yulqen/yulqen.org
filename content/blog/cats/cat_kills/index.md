Ah, springtime! A time of awakening, rebirth, burgeoning buds - and avian
bloodshed. And a good deal of mammal death, too.

This year we are taking account of the savagery, perhaps to try to atone for the
guilt we suffer for allowing [Sadie, Cinnamon and Bob]({{< relref "#the-perpetrators" >}}) 
to exact such terror on the local wildlife.

Here then is a simple list of slaughtered fauna for 2021. 

#### UPDATE: 2022

I have decided to resume updating this. Best way to do it is to include a new table for 2022. As of 17 July 2022, I've missed about two hundred kills this year, but what the hell - no time like the present.

Chris Packham - if you're reading this, you're right. Locking the cats out at night *does* result in a higher kill-rate. It's less hassle for us but more hassle for the birds. Lesson learned, but we're not doing anything about it yet. Let's watch the numbers.

<table style="font-size:10px; width:92%; padding:2px; margin:2px;">
	<colgroup>
		<col span="1" style="width:30%;" />
		<col \>
		<col \>
		<col span="1" style="width:15%" />
		<col \>
		<col \>
		<col style="width:40%">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr class="header">
			<th>Date</th>
			<th>Super species</th>
			<th>Specific species</th>
			<th>Kill Type</th>
			<th>Killer</th>
			<th>Suspect Killer</th>
			<th>Comments</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>17 July 2022</td>
			<td>Bird</td>
			<td>Sparrow</td>
			<td>DOA</td>
			<td>Unknown</td>
			<td>NA</td>
			<td>Mullered corpse lying in bloom of feathers on the utility room floor upon waking this morning. Do most of my hoovering in pyjamas nowadays.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


#### Current analysis as of 21 June 2021:

<p><em>After an active period in May, the kill-rate has slowed a bit, but we
suspect we're not seeing the victims...</em></p>
