### BASIC

Programming started in circa 1985 with BASIC on the Sinclair Spectrum 48K. I was able to do basic looping, make things flash, beep and do more complex things by copying code from books and magazines. Earned a Computing badge at Scouts after making a database (in rudimentary BASIC) for my Dad's antique business.

### HTML/Javascript

In 1999 I worked in the web team of a UK Government Department as a "Web Producer", converting to HTML Word documents sent to us on 1.44MB floppy drives. Javascript back then was for making things pop-up and flash. We used an application called Homesite for most of the markup, and Dreamweaver for some bits. Homesite and Dreamweaver!

I'd had various hobby blogs and web sites, hosted for free using space provided by my ISP (Pipex?), including one that stuck, [MadHaddy](https://web.archive.org/web/20020216192240/http://www.madhaddy.com/), about my home town in Scotland. Between 2000 and 2002 it gained a minor following. One of the pubs in the town complained when MadHaddy called it out for serving under-age drinkers. Drugs chat appearred on the forums, including folk apparently arranging deals (at the Mercat Cross, no less). After two years I took the site down to minimise the hassle - and after reading something online which claimed that I might be in some way liable for the hosting of transactions relating to the procurement of recreational drugs...

I wish the images were still available on the archive because MadHaddy was largely an exercise "satirical" photography for me - confusing the populace by Photoshopping photos of the town. Also, the purile writing, which is still a feature today... Great fun.

I still prefer flat-file web sites now of course.

### Ruby

Round about 2004, I got sucked into the Ruby/Rails wave of popularity. It was cool, but never really stuck, other than as a gateway to more sustainable drugs...

### Python

... such as Python, which did stick.
