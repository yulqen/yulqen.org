## About / Now

My name Matthew Lemon and I am 46 years old (in 2021).

Yulqen is a deliberate misspelling of an Autechre song I like.

The image below I created many years ago in a computer program I'm not even sure exists now
(actually, [it does](https://info.e-onsoftware.com/home) - called Vue). I have,
at times been very interested in 3D modelling and photography amongst other
hobbies.

I was a wedding photographer for a while.

I currently live in Berwick-upon-Tweed.

This is my umpteenth web site.

I have [three cats that kill]({{< ref "blog/cats/cat_kills/" >}} "Cat Kill
Log").
