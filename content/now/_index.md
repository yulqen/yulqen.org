### Bash

After flirting with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) for a time this year, I'm back on bash on all systems. Core tools, POSIX, familiarity, universality. fish is nice interactively but one of the biggest time-savers I get from it is from completion and the ease of searching through history, which bash can do perfectly well itself - it's just not quite so slickly-implemented.

### Goodbye sourcehut and hello again [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/)

cgit's site is down at the moment with a 502. However, I still think it's a great way to self-host your git repos. I still have a presence on Github, which is pretty much a requirement unfortunately, and I have been on and off of [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/) for a couple of years now. I do like sourcehut's dedication to core git principles (using email for patches, etc) and the simplicity of the site, without all the social aspects and my continuous dislike of M$ which will always bedevil Github in my eyes. I almost left sr.ht after the massive DDOS outage several months ago and I can see it happening again with their founder being embroiled in another bout of internet warfare (see the ill-advised hit-piece he is allegedly responsible for: [The Stallman Report](https://stallman-report.org/)). I'm not risking that happening again and would rather avoid the guy if possible, so I cancelled my account in October.

My git repos at [here](http://git.yulqen.org) - the list will grow over the next month or two as I migrate everything.

### OpenBSD

Update: October 2024:

I am running OpenBSD on my desktop in a vm again - it's been some time since I used OpenBSD in that environment.
As always, the consistency and simplicity is very appealing and resonates with my goal of moving back to "core tools" only - UNIX-like operating systems being an example of a core tool.
