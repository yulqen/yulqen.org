### Fish

I'm back on fish on all desktop and laptop systems. I should probably stop writing about switching technologies, otherwise I will not be able to keep up

### Moving to Hetzner

I admit to having lost a bit of interest in FreeBSD and BSD recently - particulary FreeBSD jails. I have been running a number of services in jails on a Vultr instance over the last year and it's been working well, but I'm not as familiar with jails as I am with Docker, nor as familiar with FreeBSD compared to Debian and Linux generally. Purely for the sake of saving some mental overhead (and money) I am currently in the process of moving these services off Vultr onto Debian machines at Hetzner. I enjoy OpenBSD more than FreeBSD but I will retire by OpenBSD proxy server too once this migration is complete, and go with a stock Debian machine running nginx.
